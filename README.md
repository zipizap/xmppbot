# xmppbot
xmpp bot which regexp-matches messages from known-contacts, and executes corresponding binaries for them 

# How to use this

```
cp xmppbot.config.yaml.example xmppbot.config.yaml
```

And then edit `xmppbot.config.yaml` with your login details, allowed contacts, and regexp-binaries to execute ;)
